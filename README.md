### Template repo for Homework submission

## Naming Standards:
1. Folders shall be named after the week the homework was assigned (with a two digit number)
   e.g.  Week03

2. Homework assignment shall be named according to the following format:
   this is the homework that was assigned during class #3
       DS_HW03.ipynb  
   this is the homework that was assigned during class #4 with an optional description:
       DS_HW04-API.ipynb

## IPython Notebook Guidelines:
1. Only cells necessary to the assignment shall be included.
    (You may start with a copy of the lab, but then before submission the superfluous cells shall be removed)

2. Any configurations (database, credentials, etc shall be defined in the first possible cell)
    (e.g. the enron database is opened in the first cell)
