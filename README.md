### Template repo for Homework submission

## Naming Standards:
1. Folders shall be named after the week the homework was assigned (with a two digit number)
   e.g.  Week03

2. Homework assignment shall be named according to the following format: <br/>
   DS_HW(two digit class number):<br/>
   e.g. this is the homework that was assigned during class #3<br/>
       DS_HW03.ipynb  <br/>
   e.g. this is the homework that was assigned during class #4 with an optional description:<br/>
       DS_HW04-API.ipynb<br/>

## IPython Notebook Guidelines:
1. Only cells necessary to the assignment shall be included.<br/>
    (You may start with a copy of the lab, but then before submission the superfluous cells shall be removed)

2. Any configurations (database, credentials, etc shall be defined in the first possible cell)<br/>
    (e.g. the enron database is opened in the first cell)
